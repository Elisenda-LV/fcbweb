3. **Use of Services**: Encapsulate business logic and data access in services.
4. **Testing**: Write tests for your code, especially for critical components and services.
 

### 📍Development Tools

#### 🧩Testing
We've used Karma and Jasmine for testing. Write tests for your code.  To run the tests, use:

'''sh
ng test

#### 🧩Prettier

To maintain consistent formatting throughout the code, we've added Prettier. Prettier will automatically format the code.


#### 🧩ESLint

To ensure we follow best practices and maintain clean code, we've added ESLint. ESLint analyzes the code and highlights potential errors and bad practices.

To run ESLint, use:

```sh
npm run lint
